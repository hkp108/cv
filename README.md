# Harsheet Patel

A former community pharmacist, now aspiring software developer who is enthusiastic about learning to build software with well-written and clean code. I am looking for junior development position to extend on the diverse skills that I have learnt at Makers Academy and adding value whilst exploring new technologies.

## Skills

###### A team-player.

Prior to Makers Academy, I successfully led the pharmacy teams in providing high standards of customer service. At Makers Academy we pair-programmed daily to solve coding problems and worked on group projects following Agile principles such as Kanban.

###### Curious

I am hungry for knowledge and love researching about various topics I don't understand well. I particularly enjoy learning about how things work and love exploring new languages and technologies.

######  Meticulous
As a pharmacist, I routinely showed great attention to detail whilst screening patient prescriptions to ensure safe dispensing of medications to patients. During my time at makers, this ability has enabled me to quickly spot typo's or missing semi-colons thereby saving time when debugging code.

## Projects

|Project Name | Description | Technologies Used |
| ---- |  ---- | ---- |
| [Stumbler](https://github.com/olmesm/pubcrawler) | A pub crawl app we created in only two weeks. <br> It generates a list of nine random pubs, close to your location with a random challenge to be completed at the respective pub. | Ionic<br>Rails<br>RSpec<br>Karma<br>Protractor|
| [Recommend 'n' Chill](https://github.com/gvonkoss/recommend-n-chill) |  An application to store a list of movies you have seen and recommend movies that you have not seen, using an external API to gather movie data and internal API to store data. | Rails<br>RSpec<br>Karma<br>Protractor |
